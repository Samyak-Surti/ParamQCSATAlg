Implementation of algorithm to efficiently verify QCSAT instance with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s" /> total gates, of which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t " /> are T-gates and the rest are Clifford gates. We aim to demonstrate the paper's theoretical result of exponential runtime scaling only in the number of T-gates.
