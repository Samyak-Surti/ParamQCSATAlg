## [The Parameterized Complexity of Quantum Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08119)
* Implementation of algorithm to efficiently verify QCSAT instance with $s$ total Quantum gates, of which $t$ are T-gates and the rest are Clifford gates. We aim to demonstrate the paper's theoretical result of exponential runtime scaling only in the number of T-gates.
Additionally, we implemented a greedy algorithm to compute the approximate stabilizer rank of optimal input states for QCSAT instances.
