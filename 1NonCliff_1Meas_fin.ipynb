    "#### Adding T-gate Conjugation Functionality\n",
    "* One of the drawbacks of using stim is that it exclusively makes use of stabilizer circuits\n",
    "* Therefore, need to come up with a way to incorporate the behavior of conjugating Paulis by a T-gate\n",
    "* Options:\n",
    "    * Define a number of shots for random cliffords. Iterating over this number of shots, randomly, instead of placing a clifford gate, simulate action of T-gate on \n",
    "    current Pauli (I believe this will be easier to implement)\n",
    "        * Define number of shots to sample cliffords\n",
    "        * Start with pre-determined number of $T$-gates (Start with 1 for now)\n",
    "        * For one of the shots (choose random integer from 0 to num_shots - 1) apply T gate as opposed to random clifford\n",
    "        * Have list of tableaus where each element of list will be a summand.\n",
    "        * Apply current stabilizer tableau to each element of list\n",
    "        * In the end, there should be a list of tableaus on which we can apply each to a z-gate on the first qubit (via conjugation) to get out Sum of Paulis\n",
    "    * Try to download stim locally and define a T-gate so that it is symbolically represented as a sum of stabilizer tableaus.\n",
    "        * It can be written in the following way:\n",
    "        $$T = \\bigg(\\cos \\bigg(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\bigg) - \\sin \\bigg(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\bigg)\\bigg) \\mathbb{I} + e^{-i\\pi/4} \\sqrt{2}sin \\bigg(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\bigg) S$$"
